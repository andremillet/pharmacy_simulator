# Pharmacy Simulator

## Description

The Pharmacy Simulator is a web-based application designed to decrypt and display medication prescriptions from encrypted .med files generated by the Medical Encounter Module. Built with Python and Flask, it allows users to upload a .med file and its corresponding .key file, decrypts the contents, and shows only the medication-related information—specifically the medication name, dose, and administration instructions—ensuring that other sensitive patient data remains hidden.

## Features

- File Upload: Accepts .med and .key files via a simple web form.
- Decryption: Uses the provided .key file to securely decrypt the .med file.
- Medication Display: Extracts and displays only medication prescriptions (name, dose, administration) from the decrypted data.
- Security: Processes files in memory without storing them, limiting visibility to pharmacy-relevant data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask (version 2.3.2)
- Cryptography (version 41.0.3)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/andremillet/pharmacy-simulator.git
2. Navigate to the directory: cd pharmacy-simulator
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the application: python app.py
5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5000

## Usage

1. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000
2. Upload a .med file (e.g., treatment_plan_1.med) and its matching .key file (e.g., key_1.key)
3. Click "Decrypt and View" to see a table listing only the medication name, dose, and administration instructions
4. Errors (e.g., invalid key, no medications) are displayed as flash messages

## Project Structure

- pharmacy_simulator/
  - app.py: Flask application
  - templates/
    - index.html: Web interface template
  - static/
    - style.css: Basic styling
  - requirements.txt: Dependencies

## Limitations

- Assumes .med files follow the JSON structure of the Medical Encounter Module
- No persistent storage; files are processed in memory and discarded after display
- Basic security; production use requires authentication and access controls
